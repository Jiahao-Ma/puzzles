# Puzzles: Unbounded Video-Depth Augmentation for Scalable End-to-End 3D Reconstruction
This repository hosts the project page for [**Puzzles**](https://jiahao-ma.github.io/puzzles/), a method that augments 3D reconstruction training by generating diverse novel viewpoints and realistic camera trajectories from single images or video clips, enabling scalable training for 3D reconstruction models. For the official implementation, please refer to the [**Puzzles-code**](https://github.com/Jiahao-Ma/puzzles-code).
