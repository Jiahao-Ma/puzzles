# Puzzles: Unbounded Video-Depth Augmentation for Scalable End-to-End 3D Reconstruction
This repository hosts the project page for **Puzzles**, a method that augments 3D reconstruction training by generating diverse novel viewpoints and realistic camera trajectories from single images or video clips, enabling scalable training for 3D reconstruction models.
